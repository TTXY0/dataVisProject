# Sleep State Visualization Project

This repository contains my Data Visualization class project for the [Child Mind Institute Detect Sleep States Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states).

## Description

I used a Random Forest Classifier to characterize sleep onset and sleep end states from physiological signals. The results are displayed interactively using Streamlit in the `Exploratory_Visualization.py` script.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TTXY0/BeerLawPhotonModel.git
   cd BeerLawPhotonModel
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app to explore the visualization:

```bash
streamlit run Exploratory_Visualization.py
```

This will open a local web server where you can interact with the sleep state visualizations and model results.
